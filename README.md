Software Engineering Project

UPDATE: THRUSDAY 11/16/2017 - Project Status:

#Hello guys, I have upload it the most recent version of the project. If you can, please do the following:

1. If you have any picture, put them inside the folder inside the category that fits the best. For example, if you are using a background of a shooting game, put "backg_shooting.png" inside "background" folder.

2. css files, please put them inside the css folder.

3. js files, inside the js folder

4. I think it's time to start linking the pages, my page are the following:

    *index.html [Main page]
    *page_aboutus.html [about us page]
    *page_contactus.html [contact us page]
    *page_others.html [others genre games page]
    *page_racing.html [racing genre games page]
    
5. I still need the news I'm going to print in the index page, and Ibrahima resume.
    
Nevertheless, let's try to meet the following week for address the final steps. Any questions just shoot me a message

Have a nice weekend!!!

Adding to this file: I have uploaded page_adventure and page_shooter as well as their css, images, and java script files.  All of the links on these pages work if I had a correct target for the link, if not I defaulted to a link to the index page until the correct one is made available.  The pages: page_contactus.html and page_racing.html did no go to the correct pages.  If you click on those pages in the project, they do not bring up the correct pages, so it isn't the links that are incorrect. Also the paypal buttons work and link to a paypal account I made for Galaxy Games.  The html for those is found on either page_adventure or page_shooter. The social media links work, but they just go to the default social media site location as we do not have social media accounts set up specifically for the project.  I hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving and a great weekend, I feel accomplished and look forward to discussing the project this week.
