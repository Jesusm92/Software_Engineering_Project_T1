Software Engineering Project

UPDATE: THRUSDAY 11/16/2017 - Project Status:

#Hello guys, I have upload it the most recent version of the project. If you can, please do the following:

1. If you have any picture, put them inside the folder inside the category that fits the best. For example, if you are using a background of a shooting game, put "backg_shooting.png" inside "background" folder.

2. css files, please put them inside the css folder.

3. js files, inside the js folder

4. I think it's time to start linking the pages, my page are the following:

    *index.html [Main page]
    *page_aboutus.html [about us page]
    *page_contactus.html [contact us page]
    *page_others.html [others genre games page]
    *page_racing.html [racing genre games page]
    
5. I still need the news I'm going to print in the index page, and Ibrahima resume.
    
Nevertheless, let's try to meet the following week for address the final steps. Any questions just shoot me a message

Have a nice weekend!!!
