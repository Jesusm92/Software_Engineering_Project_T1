Software Engineering Project

UPDATE: FRIDAY 12/08/2017 - Project Status: Completed

Guys, the project is completed. This is the last version. I do not plan to modify anything else. I have deleted every single file that is not used to reduce the project size and to optimize it.

The project now supports dynamic resolution, meaning that if the resolution used is less than X amount of pixel it will modify itself to fit in the desired resolution. I also added buttoms to every game in the index page, as well as a description text of each game.

Please review the page's code (general), let me know if you don't understand how it works. Each of us have to explain a section of the web. See you soon
